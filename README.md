# Marketing Analysis using SQL


## Project Breakdown

1. *Traffic Analysis & Optimization*

    I analyze where website traffic is coming from, traffic volume and conversion rates of different sources, and how budget can be optimized by adjusting bids.

2. *Website Measurement & Testing*

    I dig deeper into page-level website data and compare traffic and conversion rates. This leads to the analysis of conversion funnels to optimize customer experience.
    
3. *Mid Evaluation*
    
    I answer key questions aimed at evaluating the progress of the new product and its marketing strategies for the executive board meeting.
    
4. *Channel Analysis & Optimization*

    I dive deeper into traffic channel mix and explore paid vs. free traffic and mobile vs. desktop performance. This leads to some time-series analyses to uncover trends and
    seasonality.
    
5. *Product-Level Analysis*
    
    I analyze sales, conversion rates, and cross-selling patterms on a product-level and keep a pulse on the product quality by using refund rates.
    
6. *User-Level Analysis*

    I analyze user behavior such as repeat sessions and identify most valuable customers and their originating channels.
    
7. *Final Evaluation*

    I'm tasked with developing a data-driven growth story for potential investors.
